## Running locally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Clone the repository, open an emulator or connect your Android device with your "Developer options " on. Have a look at how to turn developer options on [here](https://www.greenbot.com/article/2457986/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html).


To reveal your connected devices run

    flutter doctor -v

Accept Android licenses if needed and then run

    flutter run


## Build and deploy

To build the application for all the architectures run

    flutter build apk

Run the following command to split the apk by phone CPU architecture

    flutter build apk --split-per-abi

You will be able to see your phone CPU architecture using the `flutter doctor -v` command.

Once done, connect the device that you want to install the application on and then run:

    flutter install


## Description

Send reminders easily via SMS messages. Don't worry anymore, just send a reminder.

First on we need to start the Reminder API service and to tunnel it using `ngrok` as see in the image.

![](img/start_service.png)

Now validate the required `ngrok` tunnel by inputting it's id in the `Tunnel ID` field ...

![](img/input_tunnel_id.png)

Input the tunnel id and hit connect to connect to the reminder service. Keep in mind that by default, [Reminder API](https://github.com/Horiapavel98/reminder-api-pub) runs on localhost port 8080. The port can be changed at will from the API props.

Next on we transition to the reminder screen.
